# Post-processing of Metagenomic Data: Focus on Mobile Genetic Elements

Welcome to the tutorial **Post-processing of Metagenomic Data: Focus on Mobile Genetic Elements**, based on the study:

> Calderón-Osorno, M., Rojas-Villalta, D., Lejzerowicz, F. et al. (2025). *The influence of depth on the global deep-sea plasmidome*. Scientific Reports, 15, 2959. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-025-86098-5

This tutorial walks you through the post-processing steps of metagenomic data, with a particular focus on mobile genetic elements (MGEs), using data derived from the analysis of 81 deep-sea metagenomes. The goal is to understand how ocean depth influences plasmidome composition across a global dataset.

## Overview

In this repository, you will find:

- Example data used in the original study  
- Jupyter notebooks to replicate the post-processing pipeline  

---

## Study Background

The original study investigates how depth shapes the composition and diversity of mobile genetic elements in deep-sea microbial communities. Key points include:

- The characterization of plasmidomes from 81 global deep-sea metagenomic samples.
- Use of multiple bioinformatics tools to identify, annotate, and compare MGEs.
